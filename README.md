# GLITCHSCAPE

Welcome to Glitchscape! You are a rebel spy, braving the deepest levels of underground security and avoiding the evil drones as you go. If you're lucky, you may encounter lightning candy to give you a speed boost or snow powder to slow down the drones. You can also use your special power: the ability to glitch through walls!
